# 🧠 RL-Healthcare-Agent: Personalized Treatment with Reinforcement Learning

This project explores how reinforcement learning can be used to recommend personalized treatment strategies for chronic diseases, starting with a simulated patient environment inspired by diabetes care.

## 🚀 Goals

- Design a custom Gym environment to simulate patient health
- Train an RL agent (PPO) to recommend treatment actions
- Share learnings via Twitter, Medium, and a future research paper

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Stable-Baselines3
- Gymnasium
- Google Colab
- WandB

## 📁 Project Structure

- `env/` – Custom Gym environment
- `agents/` – RL models
- `notebooks/` – Training & evaluation notebooks
- `articles/` – Blog drafts and documentation
- `data/` – (Optional) simulated/real patient data
